Source code for my blog www.minh.io. Feel free to use it however you like per
the MIT license below but pplease update the google analytics and disqus settings in 
_config.yml as well as the google webmaster verification googlebb049deae73e476f.html.

To deploy this website, simply run "jekyll serve" from the root of this 
directory and navigate to localhost:4000. Otherwise, deploy the static contents 
from the generated _site directory by running "jekyll"

Common jekyll commands include:

* Create a post: rake post title="Hello World"
* Create a page: rake page name="about.md"
* Create a nested page: rake page name="pages/about.md"

This site was built on the work of many open source projects, which I'm
very thankful for:

* Twitter bootstrap
* Jekyll
* Jekyll Bootstrap (http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)
* Robot icon (http://findicons.com/icon/40514/robot?id=415175), Tets (Rodrigo Tejero)
* Jekyll search (http://alexpearce.me/2012/04/simple-jekyll-searching/), http://alexpearce.me/

Since all of the above products are open sourced and MIT as far as I know,
you are free to use and modify my code according to the MIT license below.
If you do end up using any of the code please let me know though since I'll
be interested to see what others create (minhongrails@gmail.com).
