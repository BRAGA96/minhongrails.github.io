Source code for my blog www.minh.io. Feel free to use it however you like
but please update the google analytics and disqus settings in _config.yml

To deploy this website, simply run "jekyll --server" from the root of this 
directory and navigate to localhost:4000. Otherwise, deploy the static contents 
from the generated _site directory.

This site was built on the work of many open source projects, which I'm
very thankful for:

* Twitter bootstrap
* Jekyll
* Jekyll Bootstrap
* Robot icon (http://findicons.com/icon/40514/robot?id=415175), Tets (Rodrigo Tejero)
* Jekyll search (http://alexpearce.me/2012/04/simple-jekyll-searching/), http://alexpearce.me/
