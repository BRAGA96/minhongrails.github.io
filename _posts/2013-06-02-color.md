Recently I came across <a href="http://www.ianli.com/isee/make.php" target="_blank">Ian Li's "I See"</a>
project which visualizes text through different colors. It looked awesome and I especially liked 
how it responded immediately to text input. Naturally, I had to create my own version of it, so here's my attempt:

<br>
<center><a href="http://color.minh.io"><img src="/assets/img/color_large.jpg" alt="color_large.jpg" title="Launch Color"></a></center>
<br>

It actually took quite a bit of effort to build this but overall it
turned out decently. I got a chance to play with Raphael JS and perform
hue transforms on RGB colors (yay matrix math). There's still some things I want
to do so that I'm not totally just copying Ian's project:

* Add NLP to show different colors showing sentiment/emotion. I did a little
research and apparently there's a lot of <a href="http://www.color-wheel-pro.com/color-meaning.html" target="_blank">meaning</a> behind colors. Whether colors
can depict sentiment/emotion is debatable, but the purpose of this experiment
is to find out:

<table class="table table-bordered colorTable">
    <tr bgcolor="#f9f9f9">
        <td>Color</td>
        <td>Positive Meaning</td>
        <td>Negative Meaning</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="red"></td>
        <td>Energy, passion, strength, power, determination, desire, love</td>
        <td>Anger, war, danger</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="orange"></td>
        <td>Passion, desire, love</td>
        <td>Anger, danger</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="yellow"></td>
        <td>Passion, desire, love</td>
        <td>Anger, danger</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="green"></td>
        <td>Passion, desire, love</td>
        <td>Anger, danger</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="blue"></td>
        <td>Calm</td>
        <td>Anger</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="purple"></td>
        <td>Calm</td>
        <td>Anger</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="white"></td>
        <td>Calm</td>
        <td>Anger</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="black"></td>
        <td>Calm</td>
        <td>Anger</td>
    </tr>
</table>


Another area I'm very interested in exploring is image processing and in particular
the ability to create filters to add different color tones to images.

Anyway, give Color a try <a href="http://color.minh.io">here</a>.
