I'm never really happy with my designs, which is why I'm constantly trying to
improve them. My latest efforts have focused on improving readability through
better typography and fonts. I found lots of inspiration in <a href="http://www.medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a>,
which has beautiful, large fonts with a simplistic yet responsive look. So, today
I began working on a new design, which can be seen <a href="http://test3.minh.io" target="_blank">here</a>.
It's still rough around the edges but practice makes perfect so hopefully I'll
eventually make it appear the way I want.
