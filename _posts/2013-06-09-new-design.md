I'm never happy with my designs, which is why I'm constantly trying to
improve them. My latest efforts have focused on improving usability and readability through
better typography and responsive design. As a user with a high resolution screen,
I often increase the font size of my browser to view sites with small fonts. 
On mobile, some sites don't even have mobile views, which hurts

Therefore, I greatly simplified my design and increased the default
font size so that users shouldn't need to zoom in and should have an optimal
view in their mobile device. I found inspiration in <a href="http://www.medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a>,
which has beautiful typography for optimal readability on all sorts of screens.
I also came across Zach Holman's <a href="http://zachholman.com" target="_blank">web site</a> and
so I "borrowed" some of his design elements. Lastly, the new design also
was heavily influenced by Apple.com and a Tumblr blog called <a href="http://all-thats-interesting.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">"all that's interesting."</a>

I'm still not entirely satisfied with my design so of course I'll be updating it
again in the future. In particular, I want to make it less boring and add images
or color.
