In this post I wanted to describe why I skipped business school and an MBA.
Several years ago I had an opportunity to attend business school.
I prepared for months, took the GMAT, and asked for recommendations.
It was a great feeling to receive the acceptance letter. However, in all my
enthusiasm, I didn't carefully consider the two great costs of going to
business school: time and money.

Business school is expensive. Since I was going to enroll part-time, there
wasn't really any financial aid and I was looking at loans of $80k+ just
in tuition. Furthermore, I would be spending at least 20 extra hours a week
for lectures and outside work. After considering all of this, I decided
against it.

My reasoning was that I could better utilize my time on my own projects and
learn the material that I needed. I discovered during graduate school
that my favorite classes were the ones where I could come up with my own
projects; basically the classes where I could control my own learning. 
If I attended business school there would most likely be classes where I would
be learning material that didn't interest me.
