In this post I wanted to describe why I skipped business school and an MBA.
Several years ago I had an opportunity to attend business school.
I prepared for months, took the GMAT and asked for recommendations.
It was a great feeling to receive the acceptance letter. However, in all my
enthusiasm, I didn't carefully consider the two great costs of going to
business school: time and money.

Business school is expensive. Since I was going to enroll part-time, there
wasn't really any financial aid and I was looking at loans of $80k+ just
in tuition. Furthermore, I would be spending at least 20 extra hours a week
for lectures and outside work. After considering all of this, I decided
against attending.

I believe school teaches you skills far more valuable than the actual subject
material: the ability to learn and the discipline to meet your goals. While
attending graduate school I also discovered that you learn much better studying
topics that interest you. Furthermore, instead of spending $80k, why not learn
what you like on your own and spend that $80k towards an actual business?

Anyway, I have nothing against MBAs and those who choose to attend business 
school since everyone's situation is different. For instance, if my MBA was
all paid for or from a top 10 business school then it would've been a harder
decision, although the time cost still would've been expensive. Nonetheless, I found one amusing MBA video:

Another amusing quote (again I have nothing against MBAs):
