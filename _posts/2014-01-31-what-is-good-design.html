A while ago I was asked "what is good design?" and I don't think I gave a great answer. There's plenty of existing literature
on this subject but I thought I would answer it from the perspective of a software engineer.

<div class="mSpotlight">Good design is functional</div>

Users utilize software to accomplish tasks such as emailing, searching, listening to music, and so on.
If a user interface doesn't help the user because it's buggy or presents obstacles then it's failed. Users
can actually be very forgiving of "poorly designed" software as long as it addresses their goals:

<br><br>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tr>
        <td><a href="http://www.craigslist.com">CraigsList</a></td>
        <td>"Poorly designed" but very functional</td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="http://www.pof.com">Plenty of Fish</a></td>
        <td>Ads galore but still the most popular dating site</td>
    </tr>
</table>

So what can I do as an engineer? It's easier said than done but I strive to create functional, bug-free code that
helps users; this involves continuous testing, user/customer interviews, and well written software.

<div class="mSpotlight">Good design is simple</div>

User interfaces often create extra work for users by displaying too much irrelevant information. Here are some quotes
that illustrate the importance of simplicity:

<br><br>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tr>
        <td>"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."</td>
        <td>Steve Jobs, quoting Leonardo da Vinci</td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter"</td>
        <td>Mark Twain</td>
    </tr>
</table>

As a matter of fact, I often go through posts trying to remove as many words as possible.

<div class="mSpotlight">Great design elicits emotion</div>

As an engineer I hope to improve users' lives and create an impact with an ultimate goal of eliciting feelings which
        may include happiness, delight, surprise, and so on.

<div class="mSpotlight">Conclusion</div>

I borrowed lots of points from Apple's "Designed by Apple - Intention" commercial:
