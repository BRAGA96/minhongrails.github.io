It seems that I update this blog's design nearly every month. Well, this
month is no exception and here's the latest changes:

* Improved readability by increasing font sizes and improving contrast
* Added background to improve contrast / readability

Overall, I was heavily influenced by <a href="http://pixelunion.net/">Pixel Union</a>.

This design change is still a work in progress but for reference, below
is the older <a href="http://design4.minh.io">2.5 release</a>.
