(This is a post in progress... still have some unanswered questions ...)

In this post I wanted to share my research with creating a company. Please
keep in mind that these are just my notes and by no means am I qualified 
to provide this information. However, I try to provide references when
possible to back up my claims.

With that out of the way, the primary reasons I decided to create a company
were:

<ol>

<li>Separate and protect personal assets from company assets</li>

<li>Save money in taxes</li>

</ol>

After tinkering with Turbotax Business and researching different corporations,
I decided that an LLC would be the easiest and cheapest option because
it allowed for pass through taxation and required low regulatory overhead. 
Pass through taxation is especially helpful in the early years of a company
because it allows founders to deduct startup expenses (up to $5000 in the 
year a company is started) and other costs against ordinary income. Other
deductions may include company assets like computer hardware, travel, capital
loss, etc.

Overall, the math came down to this: if I spend more than $750 a year in 
business expenses then I can deduct ~40% of that, or at least $300,
which means I would break even on LLC maintenance costs ($300 a year for a 
Delaware LLC).

The cost, however, is that all expenses must be tied to my company with 
detailed bookkeeping (i.e. receipts, separate company bank account, credit, etc)
and if the company ever goes bankrupt then collectors could come after company
assets. However, this appears to be a step up from not having an LLC since
they could also then come after my personal assets.

<b>Questions remaining</b>

1. Is an LLC subject to the $3000 net capital loss rule where only a maximum
$3000 net capital loss can be deducted against ordinary income?
