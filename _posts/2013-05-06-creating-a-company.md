In this post I wanted to share my research with creating a company.
For the record, this is my first company so I might have missed some points. 
Nonetheless, below are my findings:

<h2>Benefits</h2>

First off, why even create a company? Ideally it would be to create 
great products and services. However, this often costs money and takes risk
so generally it's worthwhile to find assistance. With that said, here are
some reasons to formally incorporate a company:

<b>Separate and protect personal assets from company assets</b>

If a company is created and operated correctly then in the event of a 
bankruptcy or other unfortunate event, creditors can only claim company
assets rather than the personal assets of founders like cars, houses, etc.

<b>Save money in taxes</b>

The U.S. is probably one of the best places to be an entrepreneur since
the government offers lots of assistance for new companies in the form
of tax deductions:

<ol>

<li><b>Deduct expenses for initial formation</b> (startup costs), travel, business entertainment, travel, etc. 
There are much better sources out there that document the rules better but
just know that there's lots of helpful deductions</li>

<li><b>No 2% rule for deductions</b> (needs to be verified). As far as I know, businesses
are not subject to the <a href="http://www.1040.com/federal-taxes/deductions/itemized-deductions" target="_blank">2% minimum AGI rule</a>, meaning that if a pass-through corporation is selected (e.g. LLC or S-corp) then 
a founder can claim deductions less than 2% of their AGI. Admittedly this won't
matter in the long term but it helps a bit in the early years. </li>

<li><b>No maximum $3000 capital losses write off</b> (needs to be verified). Under 
personal taxes, the maximum tax write off is $3000 for capital losses with
any unclaimed losses being carried forward to future years (<a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Ten-Important-Facts-About-Capital-Gains-and-Losses" target="_blank">Rule #8 on IRS website</a>). While this is 
not ideal (you shouldn't want to write off losses), even if a company
held capital gains not yet realized then it could sell all of its capital
losses for a year and write off a loss even if it had a great year on paper. 
With pass-through taxation, a founder could theoretically have zero taxes, although
admittedly this is a very rare situation. This trick may also be how large
corporations are able to have 0% taxes for certain years (in addition to
off-shore tax havens).</li>

</ol>

<h2>How to create a company</h2>

Surprisingly, it seems that it's very easy to create a company. From my research,
it costs $591 to register an LLC in Maryland and $300 a year thereafter for
franchise fees. There's additional costs of $

There are plenty of sites that provide more detailed and official guidance,
so I won't go over the exact details:

<ul>

</ul>

There are several corporation types but for my purposes (creating a technology
company with products and services that are financed through
a seed investment fund) it made sense to go with a Delaware LLC, mostly
because of its efficiency and popularity with startups. 
Additionally, while even Peter Thiel has advised founders to create Delaware C corporations, 
I don't expect my company to be bought out anytime soon so I'll prefer to
keep my initial tax advantages and less stringent formality requirements. Down
the road I can convert my LLC to a C corporation if I ever need outside investments.

Nonetheless, here are some general highlights from my research:

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <tr>
        <td>Corporation Type</td>
        <td>Ongoing Costs</td>
        <td>Ongoing Requirements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>LLC</td>
        <td>For a Delaware LLC, $250 yearly tax.</td>
        <td>No formalities required</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>S corp</td>
        <td>For a Delaware S corp, $250 yearly tax? (needs verification)</td>
        <td>Shareholder meetings, documenting company decisions, etc </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C corp</td>
        <td>For a Delaware C corp, $250 yearly tax? (needs verification)</td>
        <td>Shareholder meetings, documenting company decisions, etc </td>
    </tr>

<h2>When not to create a company</h2>

<ul>
    <li>When you don't spend at least $1190 on expenses on your business. ($1190 * 40% taxes = $476, which
is roughly the cost of of Delaware LLC taxes and the cost of a registered agent)</li>
    <li>If your company's business conflicts with your day job or previous contracts</li>
</ul>
