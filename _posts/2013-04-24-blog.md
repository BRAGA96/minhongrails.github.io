This post will describe how I created this website and blog. In a nutshell, the
key ingredients were: 
<ul>
    <li>Linode with Ubuntu (VPS web hosting) - $20/month + $5/month for backups</li>
    <li>Nginx - fast static content web server</li>
    <li>Jekyll - blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby</li>
    <li>Bootstrap - UI framework w/ responsive design</li>
    <li>Jekyll Bootstrap - open source starter kit</li>
    <li>Disqus - open source starter kit</li>
    <li>Git - great source control system</li>
</ul>

This entire site is open sourced <a href="https://github.com/minhongrails/blog" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Previously I've created a lot of websites and blogs using Wordpress, Drupal, and shared hosting
and for anyone starting out with zero budget, I would recommend they look into

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.byethost.com">http://www.byethost.com</a>  - PHP, free hosting, no ads</li>
<li><a href="http://www.000webhost.com">http://www.000webhost.com</a> - PHP, free hosting, no ads, 
    kept getting 502 bad gateway errors on my phone, so I switched to byethost</li>
</ul>


There are of course lots of easier options like Wordpress, Tumblr, etc, but generally
I want more freedom in my technology stack (i.e. not just PHP or a WP plugin, etc)
so I moved towards Linode after reading great reviews and the fact that it's
fast for the price.
