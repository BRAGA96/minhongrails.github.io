This post will describe how I created this website and blog. In a nutshell, the
key ingredients were: Linode (VPS web hosting), nginx (fast static content web server), 
Jekyll (static site generator), bootstrap (responsive design), and git (source control).

Previously I've created a lot of websites and blogs using Wordpress and shared hosting
and for anyone starting out, I would recommend they look into

<ul>
<li>http://www.byethost.com/  (PHP free hosting)</li>
</ul>

However, I wanted to have more freedom with my technology stack (i.e. not just PHP)
so I moved towards Linode after reading great reviews and the fact that it's
fast for just $20/month.

Anyway, it's 1:19am so I'll come back and update this post later...
