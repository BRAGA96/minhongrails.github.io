Recently I came across <a href="http://www.ianli.com/isee/make.php" target="_blank">Ian Li's "I See"</a>
project which visualizes text through different colors. It looked awesome and I
found myself fascinated trying to associate colors with text. Naturally, I had to 
create my own version of it, so here's my attempt:
<br>
<br>
<center><a href="http://color.minh.io"><img src="/assets/img/color_large.jpg" alt="color_large.jpg" title="Launch Color"></a></center>
<br>

It actually took quite a bit of effort to build this but overall it
turned out decently. I got a chance to play with Raphael JS and perform
hue transforms on RGB colors (yay matrix math). There's still some things I want
to do so that I'm not totally just copying Ian's project:

* Add NLP to translate text to different colors showing sentiment/emotion. I did a little
research and apparently there's a lot of <a href="http://www.color-wheel-pro.com/color-meaning.html" target="_blank">meaning</a> behind colors:
<br>
<table class="table table-bordered colorTable">
    <tr bgcolor="#f9f9f9">
        <td>Color</td>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Meaning</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#FF0000"></td>
        <td>Red</td>
        <td>energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#8B0000"></td>
        <td>DarkRed</td>
        <td>vigor, willpower, rage, anger, leadership, courage, longing, malice, and wrath</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#FFB6C1"></td>
        <td>LightPink</td>
        <td>joy, sexuality, passion, sensitivity, and love</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#FFA500"></td>
        <td>Orange</td>
        <td>enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity, determination, attraction, success, encouragement, and stimulation</td>
    </tr>   
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#FF4500"></td>
        <td>OrangeRed</td>
        <td>desire, sexual passion, pleasure, domination, aggression, and thirst for action</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#FF8C00"></td>
        <td>Darkorange</td>
        <td>deceit and distrust</td>
    </tr>
</table>


Another area I'm very interested in exploring is image processing and in particular
the ability to create filters to add different color tones to images.

Anyway, give Color a try <a href="http://color.minh.io">here</a>.
