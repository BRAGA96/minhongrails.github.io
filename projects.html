        <h4>Foodwall</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Foodwall was inspired by HealthyOut, Pinterest, and Fooducate with the goal
            of creating a web based application for locating nearby food with filters
            (such as lactose free, vegetarian), lots of photos, and detailed 
            nutritional data.</p>
