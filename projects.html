        <br>
        <p>Foodwall quickly finds food near you. We show you photos in addition to
           text and we help you become a healthier and smarter diner through
           recommendations based on nutritional and ingredient data. Foodscan's
           filters allow you to only show relevant dishes that match your
           dietary preferences and/or restrictions.</p>
