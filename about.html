Hey there! I'm Minh Nguyen, a software engineer and aspiring entrepreneur, who enjoys
solving problems and building products. This site is mostly an experiment where I'm
constantly changing the design and content but my overall goals are to share my knowledge,
give back to open source, explore different technologies, and show my side projects. Other than that,
I like robots, AI, cute animals, and cool stuff.
